Hi, I know nothing about programming. I have a friend who several years ago created some early A.I type program for stock investing, which I do know something about. It took information from the internet like business news sources and attempted to figure out how supply chains would be effected (this was before the world had become familiar with the term 'supply chains' and which comes would benefit and which companies would get hurt. Or something like that. I never accessed it because he wrote it in Linux and I have no idea how to use it. Anyway, as an economist I was interested in it and he sent it to me because to pay off a debt he owed me and told me I could do anything I want with it. Somebody told me if I wanted to make it publicly available I should post it here, but since nobody knows me here, I think I need to show people I'm sincere first.
